# Random-Color-Flipper
I tried to implement my JavaScript coding knowledge into implementation.

Here It will generate random colors for the background and its color code, too.
In simple, it will choose random colors from the fixed values.
In hex, it will generate a random color from all possible hex values.

Here is the screenshot of my website.
